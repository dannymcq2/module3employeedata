# Employee-Payroll-Tracker

## Description 
My motivation was to make a simple site page that allows to collect employees payroll & name. I worked on this project because the current written code was not functioning so I modified to make it work. The problem I solved was with the java script code. I learned more about java script & how I can use it to make a website function better & cleaner. This project for module 3 challenge is a website where you can add your employee payroll, names & salary. The average will be given & each employee will be in alphabetical order. I was given previously written code that I was instructed to modify & make sure all functions work. This project can be helpful or useful for hiring managers or someone else perhaps to keep a list of employees in alphabetical order with the option to see the average salary. The site is very easy to use & navigate. The look of the site is simple & straightforward with only 1 page. 

## Code Structure and Technologies Used

This project primarily utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple and functional employee payroll tracker. Here's a brief overview of the structure of the code:

- **HTML:** The HTML file (`index.html`) provides the structure and content of the web page. It includes elements for inputting employee data and displaying the results.

- **CSS:** The CSS file (`styles.css`) styles the HTML elements, providing visual enhancements and layout adjustments for better user experience.

- **JavaScript:** The JavaScript file (`script.js`) is responsible for the dynamic behavior of the web page. It handles user interactions, such as adding employee data, calculating average salary, and sorting employees in alphabetical order.

The project follows a modular approach, with separate files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it easier to maintain and understand.
